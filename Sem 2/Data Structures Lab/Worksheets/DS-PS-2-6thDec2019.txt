1. Integers between 1 and n are stored in an array exactly once except one number. Find 
     the missing number with O(n) Time complexity.
          (eg) Numbers 1 to 10 is stored in array as follows
         A[] = { 1, 4 , 3 ,2,6,8,10,9,5}. Find the missing number(ie) 7 by traversing the array  
       only once. Also you should not use another array.

2. Suppose you have an array of 1001 integers. The integers are in random order, but you 
    know each of the integers is between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). In addition, each number 
    appears only once in the array, except for one number, which occurs twice. Assume 
    that you can access each element of the array only once. Describe an algorithm to find 
    the repeated number without using auxiliary array.
3. A child is running up a staircase with n steps and can hop either 1 step or 2 steps at a time. 
  Implement a recursive method to count how many possible ways the child can run up the stairs.

4. Given an array of positive and negative numbers, arrange them in an alternate fashion such 
that every positive number is followed by negative and vice-versa maintaining the order of appearance.
Number of positive and negative numbers need not be equal. If there are more positive numbers they 
appear at the end of the array. If there are more negative numbers, they too appear in the end of the array.
You can use O(1) extra space (ie) only one additional variable. Also the original order should be maintained.
Examples : 
Input:  arr[] = {1, 2, 3, -4, -1, 4}
Output: arr[] = {-4, 1, -1, 2, 3, 4}

Input:  arr[] = {-5, -2, 5, 2, 4, 7, 1, 8, 0, -8}
output: arr[] = {-5, 5, -2, 2, -8, 4, 7, 1, 8, 0}
